VisualOctopus is a crawler/scraper framework that collects visual data (images, videos, web page screenshots, etc.) from the web. The collected data can be used as the training source of deep learning network.

Currently this framework implements crawling mechanism for two social network websites: jiayuan.com and baihe.com. Will add renren.com later.

The auto-archiving functionality doesn't work well after the last code refactoring. Will fix it later.
